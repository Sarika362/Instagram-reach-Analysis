# Instagram Reach Analysis 📊📈

This project analyzes Instagram reach data to derive insights into the engagement and performance of Instagram posts. By leveraging various Python libraries, it provides visualizations and metrics to understand how different factors impact post reach.

## Features

- **Distribution Analysis**: Visualizes the distribution of impressions from different sources (Home, Hashtags, Explore) using histograms.
- **Percentage Breakdown**: Displays a pie chart showing the percentage of impressions from various sources, including likes, comments, shares, saves, and profile visits.
- **Word Clouds**: Generates word clouds from post captions and hashtags to highlight the most frequently used words and hashtags.
- **Scatter Plots**: Analyzes the relationship between impressions and engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, and saves) with scatter plots.
- **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Calculates the conversion rate from profile visits to follows and visualizes this relationship.
- **Prediction Model**: Builds and evaluates a regression model to predict impressions based on engagement metrics, achieving an accuracy of 91% using `PassiveAggressiveRegressor`.


## Installation

To get started, install the necessary Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly wordcloud
```

## How It Works 🔍

- **Data Loading**: 📂 Load the Instagram data from a CSV file.
- **Visualization**:
  - **Histograms**: 📊 Analyze how impressions are distributed across different sources.
  - **Pie Chart**: 🥧 View the contribution of different engagement metrics to overall impressions.
  - **Word Clouds**: ☁️ Explore the most common words and hashtags in your posts.
  - **Scatter Plots**: 🔵 Examine how engagement metrics correlate with impressions.
- **Prediction Model**: 🤖 Build and evaluate a regression model to predict impressions based on engagement metrics.
